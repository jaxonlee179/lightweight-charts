# Version 3.0 breaking change

Lighweight charts library 3.0 announces the major improvement: supporting two price scales.
In order of keeping API clear and consistent, we desided to allow breaking change of the API.
We understand disadvantages of breaking changes in the API, so we have not removed support of the current API at all, but have deprecated it, so the most common cases will continue working.
You could refer new API [here](./price-scale.md)

Following are migration rules.

## Default behavior

Default behavior is not changed. If you do not specify price scale options, the chart will have right price scale visible and all the serieses will assign to it.

## Left price scale

If you need the price scale to be drawn on the left side, you should make following changes.
instead of

```javascript
var chart = LightweightCharts.createChart(container, {
    priceScale: {
        position: 'right',
    },
});
```

use

```javascript
var chart = LightweightCharts.createChart(container, {
    rightPriceScale: {
        visible: false,
    },
    leftPriceScale: {
        visible: true,
    },
});
```

then specify target price scale while creating a series:

```javascript
var histSeries = chart.addHistogramSeries({
    priceScaleId: 'left',
});
```

New version fully supports this case via old API, however this support will be removed in the future releases.

## No price scale

To create chart without any visible price scale, instead of

```javascript
var chart = LightweightCharts.createChart(container, {
    priceScale: {
        position: 'none',
    },
});
```

use

```javascript
var chart = LightweightCharts.createChart(container, {
    leftPriceScale: {
        visible: false,
    },
    rightPriceScale: {
        visible: false,
    },
});
```

New version fully supports this case via old API, however this support will be removed in the future releases.

## Creating overlay

To create an overlay series, instead of

```javascript
var histogramSeries = chart.addHistogramSeries({
    overlay: true,
});
```

use

```javascript
var histogramSeries = chart.addHistogramSeries({
    priceScaleId: '',
});
```

New version fully supports this case via old API, however this support will be removed in the future releases.

## Move price scale from right to left or vice versa

To do this, instead of

```javascript
var chart = LightweightCharts.createChart(container);

var mainSeries = chart.addLineSeries();

...

chart.applyOptions({
    priceScale: {
        position: 'left',
    },
});
```

use

```javascript
var chart = LightweightCharts.createChart(container);

var mainSeries = chart.addLineSeries();

...

chart.applyOptions({
    leftPriceScale: {
        visible: 'true',
    },
    rightPriceScale: {
        visible: 'false',
    },
});

mainSeries.applyOptions({
    priceScaleId: 'left,
});

```

New version does not support this case via old API, so, if you use it, you should migrate your code in order of keeping it working.
