]);
```

### CDN

You can use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/):

https://unpkg.com/lightweight-charts/dist/lightweight-charts.standalone.production.js

The standalone version puts all exports from `esm` version to `window.LightweightCharts`:

```js
const chart = LightweightCharts.createChart(document.body, { width: 400, height: 300 });
const lineSeries = chart.addLineSeries();
lineSeries.setData([
    { time: '2019-04-11', value: 80.01 },
    { time: '2019-04-12', value: 96.63 },
    { time: '2019-04-13', value: 76.64 },
    { time: '2019-04-14', value: 81.89 },
    { time: '2019-04-15', value: 74.43 },
    { time: '2019-04-16', value: 80.01 },
    { time: '2019-04-17', value: 96.63 },
    { time: '2019-04-18', value: 76.64 },
    { time: '2019-04-19', value: 81.89 },
    { time: '2019-04-20', value: 74.43 },
]);
```

## Development

### Compiling

- `npm run tsc` - compiles source code only (without tests)
- `npm run tsc-watch` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode for source code (the same as `tsc`, but in watch mode)
- `npm run tsc-all` - compiles everything (source code and tests)
- `npm run tsc-all-watch` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode for source code and tests (the same as `tsc-all`, but in watch mode)

### Bundling

- `npm run rollup` - runs Rollup to bundle code
- `npm run build` - compiles source code and bundles it (a short-hand for `npm run tsc && npm run rollup`)

Note: by default only dev version is bundled.
To bundle a production builds (minified) too just set `NODE_ENV` variable to `production` and run bundling.
For example: `NODE_ENV=production npm run rollup`.

### Testing

- `npm run lint` - runs lint for the code
- `npm run test` - runs unit-tests

### Tips

To make sure that your local copy passed all (almost) checks, you can use a `verify` npm script: `npm run verify`.
