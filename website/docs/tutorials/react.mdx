title: How to use Lightweight Charts with React
---

On this page you will learn how to easily use Lightweight Charts with React.

The below procedure will use [Parcel](https://github.com/brandiqa/react-parcel-starter) but the dependencies used in package.json will also be provided to start from scratch an empty project.


### Setup your React project - using Parcel

Feel free to reuse the setup details provided by Parcel or to just copy/paste the following

```
git clone git@github.com:brandiqa/react-parcel-starter.git lwc-react
cd lwc-react
npm install
```

### Run your React project

```
// The following will create a web page accessible by default on http://localhost:1234/
npm start
```

### Setup your React project - without a project builder
If for any reason you don't want to rely on a specific builder to construct your project and are only interested in doing things manually you will only need a few dependencies.
```
// package.json
...
"dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
},
"devDependencies": {
	"@babel/core": "^7.10.2",
	"@babel/preset-env": "^7.10.2",
	"@babel/preset-react": "^7.10.1",
}
```
and then
```
npm install
```

### How to create your own Charting React component

One of the advantages of React is its ability to decompose code complexity in reusable components.
The following piece of code will show you how to create a dedicated chart component that could then be reused by other components.

The simplest component could be defined as follow. Let's defined a file that would be named `ChartComponent.tsx`

```
import { IChartApi, createChart } from "lightweight-charts";
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

export interface NonOHLCDataType {
	time: string;
	value: number;
}

export interface OHLCDataType {
	time: string;
	open: number;
	high: number;
	low: number;
	close: number;
}

export type ChartDataType = NonOHLCDataType | OHLCDataType;

export interface ChartProperties {
	data: ChartDataType[];
}

export const ChartComponent = (props: ChartProperties): JSX.Element => {
	const { data } = props;
	const chartContainerRef = useRef() as React.MutableRefObject<HTMLInputElement>;

	let mainChart: IChartApi;

	useEffect(
		() => {
			const handleResize = () => {
				mainChart?.resize(chartContainerRef.current.clientWidth, chartContainerRef.current.clientHeight);
			};

			window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

			return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
		},
		[mainChart]
	);

	useEffect(
		() => {
			mainChart = createChart(chartContainerRef.current, {
				width: 400,
				height: 300
			});

			let series = mainChart.addAreaSeries();
			series.setData(data);
		},
		[data]
	);

	return (
		<div
			ref={chartContainerRef}
		/>
	);
};
```

In another component, let's say the classical `App.tsx` you could then simply do

```
import * as React from 'react'
import { ChartComponent } from "./ChartComponent";

const data = [
	{ time: '2018-12-22', value: 32.51 },
	{ time: '2018-12-23', value: 31.11 },
	{ time: '2018-12-24', value: 27.02 },
	{ time: '2018-12-25', value: 27.32 },
	{ time: '2018-12-26', value: 25.17 },
	{ time: '2018-12-27', value: 28.89 },
	{ time: '2018-12-28', value: 25.46 },
	{ time: '2018-12-29', value: 23.92 },
	{ time: '2018-12-30', value: 22.68 },
	{ time: '2018-12-31', value: 22.67 },
];


export default function App() {
	return (
		<ChartComponent data={data}></ChartComponent>
	);
}

```

and you'll have a reusable component that could then enhance, tweak to meet your needs, adding properties and even functionalities.

If you've successfully followed all the steps you should see something similar to

import { SetupComponent } from "../../src/pages/_react/setup-component.tsx"

<SetupComponent/>
