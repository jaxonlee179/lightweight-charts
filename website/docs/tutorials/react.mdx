:::info

The following only describes a relatively simple example that only renders an [areaSeries](../series-types.md#area) that could be tweaked to render any other type of [series](../series-types.md).

For a more complete scenario where you could wrap Lightweight Chart into a component having sub components, please consult this [example](./react-complex-example).

:::

On this page you will learn how to easily use Lightweight Charts with React.

The below procedure will use [Parcel](https://github.com/brandiqa/react-parcel-starter) but the dependencies used in package.json will also be provided to start from scratch an empty project.

### Setup your React project - using Parcel

Feel free to reuse the setup details provided by Parcel or to just copy/paste the following

```
git clone git@github.com:brandiqa/react-parcel-starter.git lwc-react
cd lwc-react
npm install
```

To run your project simply

```
// The following will create a web page accessible by default on http://localhost:1234/
npm start
```

### Setup your React project - without a project builder
If for any reason you don't want to rely on a specific builder to construct your project and are only interested in doing things manually you will only need a few dependencies.
```
// package.json
...
"dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
},
"devDependencies": {
	"@babel/core": "^7.10.2",
	"@babel/preset-env": "^7.10.2",
	"@babel/preset-react": "^7.10.1",
}
```
and then
```
npm install
```

### How to create your own Charting React component

The example _React component_ on this page may not fit your requirements completely. Creating a general purpose declarative wrapper for Lightweight Chart's imperative API is a challenge, but hopefully you can adapt this example to your use case.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import code from '!!raw-loader!./../../src/pages/_react/chart-component.jsx';

<CodeBlock className="language-jsx">{code}</CodeBlock>

and you'll have a reusable component that could then be enhanced, tweaked to meet your needs, adding properties and even functionalities.

If you've successfully followed all the steps you should see something similar to

import { ChartComponent } from "../../src/pages/_react/chart-component"

<ChartComponent/>
